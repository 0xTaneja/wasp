          Thanks for trying out the AI web App Generator. Looks like it might be
          a couple of minutes before we can start building your app. In the
          meantime, you can take a look at some of our already generated apps
          below.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Come back to this page to check the status of your app at any time!
